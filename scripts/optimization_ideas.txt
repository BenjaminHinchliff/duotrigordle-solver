Early breaking:
    If there are 'N' more words to add to the list, then
      (5 * N) is the theoretical maximum number of additional letters 
      you can increase your current score by.
      If the current best running maximum is greater than or equal to
      current-score + (5 * N), then there is no reason to continue exploring, 
      and you should break early from that loop
